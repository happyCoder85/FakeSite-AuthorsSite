                    <p>"The chill of the night clung to Detective Lin's skin as he knelt beside the lifeless body. The victim's eyes stared blankly at the starless sky, a silent testament to the horror that had unfolded in this quiet corner of Turner Creek. A single symbol, etched into the flesh above the heart, mocked Lin's attempts to find a rational explanation."</p>

                    <p>"'Turner Creek isn't what it seems, Detective,' the old woman whispered, her voice barely audible over the crackling fireplace. 'The oath has been broken, and the darkness that's always simmered beneath the surface is rising. You're playing with fire, boy. Be careful, or you'll get burned.'"</p>

                    <p>"Lin traced the symbol with his fingertip, the cold metal of his badge digging into his palm. He knew this mark. He had seen it before, a haunting echo of his past. The oath was a curse, a twisted legacy that had followed him from the ashes of his childhood. And now, it threatened to consume Turner Creek, leaving nothing but ruin in its wake."</p>
